title: How to create a collection?
---

Before create NFTs, you need to create a collection for them first.

With your Mixin Messenger connected, you can find the `create` button from the dropdown menu in the navbar.

If you have not created any collections yet, it'll redirect to the collection form.

![new-collection](@site/static/img/docs/tutorials/new-collection.png)

Fill the form and click the `Save` button.

That's it.

:::warning
