title: What is fee, royalty and split?
---

## Fee

Trident will takes 2.5% from every sale happenning on the marketplace.

## Royalty

As a creator, you can choose your royalties(0% ~ 10%) when you mint your NFT. After that, you'll get the royalties deposited into your wallet every time your NFT sells.

## Split

Split is one of most interesting parts of Trident.

Split is an attribute of a collection, chosen by creator from 0% ~ 10%.

**A Collection with split means, a portion of every sale from the same collection will be taken as split, allocated to every early buyer of NFT from this collection on a pro-rata basis.**
