title: Which blockchains does Trident support?
---

Trident is built on [Mixin Network](https://mixin.one). For now, [Mixin Messenger](https://mixin.one/messenger) is the only available wallet for Trident.

However, in near future, on benefit from [MVM](https://github.com/MixinNetwork/trusted-group/blob/master/mvm/README.md) technology, Trident will support all popular blockchains, like Ethtereum.
